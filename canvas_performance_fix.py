📋 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
   Browser Warning: "Canvas2D: Multiple readback operations using getImageData 
   are faster with the willReadFrequently attribute set to true"

🔍 ROOT CAUSE:
   The QR scanner frequently reads pixel data from canvas using getImageData()
   but wasn't optimized for frequent read operations.

✅ FIXES APPLIED:

1. app/templates/scanner/index.html (line 779):
   BEFORE: canvas.getContext('2d')
   AFTER:  canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true })

2. app/templates/scanner/index.html (line 849):
   BEFORE: canvas.getContext('2d')  
   AFTER:  canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true })

🚀 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
   • Optimizes canvas for frequent getImageData() operations
   • Reduces browser overhead when scanning for QR codes
   • Eliminates console warnings during QR scanning
   • Better performance for real-time video processing

📊 TECHNICAL DETAILS:
   The willReadFrequently attribute tells the browser to optimize
   the canvas backing store for frequent pixel data reads, which
   is exactly what QR detection requires.

🎉 RESULT:
   QR scanner will now operate more efficiently with fewer 
   browser performance warnings!
