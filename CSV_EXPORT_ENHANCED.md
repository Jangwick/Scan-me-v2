# CSV Export Enhanced to Match PDF Functionality ✅

## Changes Made

### **Before (Simple CSV):**
```csv
Student Name,Student Number,Time In,Time Out,Duration (min),Status,Late
John Doe,2021-001234,08:05 AM,09:45 AM,100,Completed,Yes
Jane Smith,2021-001235,08:00 AM,09:40 AM,100,Completed,No
```

### **After (Comprehensive CSV with Header & Statistics):**
```csv
"Advanced Programming - Attendance Report"
"Date:","October 10, 2025"
"Time:","08:00 AM - 10:00 AM"
"Room:","Room 301"
"Instructor:","Prof. Johnson"

"Session Statistics"
"Total Scans:","45"
"Unique Students:","38"
"Late Arrivals:","5"
"Attendance Rate:","95.0%"

"Student Name","Student Number","Time In","Time Out","Duration (min)","Status","Late"
"John Doe","2021-001234","08:05 AM","09:45 AM",100,"Completed","Yes"
"Jane Smith","2021-001235","08:00 AM","09:40 AM",100,"Completed","No"

"System:","ScanMe Attendance System"
```

## What's Included Now

### 1. **Session Header Section**
- Session Name (as title)
- Date (formatted as "October 10, 2025")
- Time (e.g., "08:00 AM - 10:00 AM")
- Room information
- Instructor name

### 2. **Statistics Section**
- Total Scans: Total number of QR scans
- Unique Students: Number of individual students
- Late Arrivals: Count of students who arrived late
- Attendance Rate: Percentage of expected attendance

### 3. **Attendance Records Table**
- Student Name
- Student Number
- Time In (formatted as "08:05 AM")
- Time Out (or "Not yet" if still in session)
- Duration (in minutes)
- Status (Completed / In Room)
- Late (Yes / No)

### 4. **Footer Section**
- Generated timestamp

## Technical Improvements

### ✅ UTF-8 BOM Added
```javascript
const BOM = '\uFEFF';
let csv = BOM;
```
- Ensures proper encoding in Excel
- Handles special characters (accents, emojis, etc.)

### ✅ Proper CSV Escaping
```javascript
csv += `${escapeCSV(record.student_name)},${escapeCSV(record.student_no)},...`;
```
- Handles commas in names
- Escapes quotes correctly
- Prevents CSV injection

### ✅ Async Data Fetching
```javascript
const response = await fetch('{{ url_for("professor.get_session_attendance_records", session_id=session.id) }}');
const attendanceData = await response.json();
```
- Fetches real-time data from backend
- Includes all attendance fields
- Handles errors gracefully

### ✅ Progress Indicators
```javascript
showExportProgress('Fetching attendance data...');
// ... fetch data ...
showExportProgress('Generating CSV...');
// ... generate file ...
hideExportProgress();
showToast('CSV exported successfully!', 'success');
```
